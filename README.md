# Tic-Tac-Toe AI with Search Algorithms

This project implements an AI-powered Tic-Tac-Toe game using various search algorithms to determine the best moves for the computer player. The algorithms used include:

- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**  
- **Depth-First Search (DFS)**  
- **Iterative Deepening Depth-First Search (IDDFS)**  
- **Uniform Cost Search (UCS)**  

## How It Works
The game runs in the console, allowing a human player to compete against an AI that makes decisions using different search strategies. The AI explores possible moves and selects the optimal one based on the implemented search method.

## How to Run
To play against the AI using a specific algorithm, run the corresponding Python file:

```bash
python BFS.py  # Play with BFS AI
python DFS.py  # Play with DFS AI
python IDDFS.py  # Play with IDDFS AI
python UCS.py  # Play with UCS AI
```

## Features
- Interactive command-line Tic-Tac-Toe gameplay
- AI opponent utilizing different search strategies
- Win, lose, or tie detection
- Step-by-step board visualization

## Future Enhancements
- Implementing heuristic-based AI (e.g., Minimax Algorithm)
- Adding a graphical user interface (GUI)
- Optimizing search performance for better decision-making

## License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
